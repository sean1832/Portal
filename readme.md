## üîå Communication Methods

Portal supports various communication methods, each with its own strengths and drawbacks. The choice of method depends on the specific requirements of your workflow, such as speed, reliability, and whether the communication is local or remote.
> ‚≠ê Recommended methods for most use cases.

## ‚åõExample Workflow

Here's an example of how you might send a mesh from Grasshopper to another application (e.g., Blender):

1. In Grasshopper:
   - Serialize the mesh into JSON
   - Encode the JSON text into bytes
   - Compress the bytes using GZip
   - Send the compressed data via Named Pipe

2. In the receiving application (e.g., Blender):
   - Receive the compressed bytes
   - Decompress the data
   - Decode the bytes into a string
   - Parse the JSON
   - Deserialize and construct the mesh

## ‚öíÔ∏è For Developer

### Data Format

- All data is sent and received as bytes.
- Data can be compressed using GZip before sending to save bandwidth and increase transfer speed. Proper decompression handling is required on the receiving end.

### Data Types

1. **Direct Text Messages**: Simple text can be sent and received directly.

2. **Structured Data (JSON)**: Complex data structures can be sent as JSON, allowing for flexible data exchange. The receiving end must know how to handle and parse the JSON data.

3. **Geometry Data**: Geometric data (like meshes, curves) can be serialized into JSON, encoded into bytes, compressed, and then sent. The receiving end must reverse this process to reconstruct the geometry.

### Data Models

Portal provides JSON data models for various geometric entities. These models define the structure for serializing and deserializing geometric data:

#### Geometry Data Models
- [Point Data Model](/Example/data-model/point.json)
- [Mesh Data Model](/Example/data-model/mesh.json)
- [Polyline Curve Model](/Example/data-model/polyline-curve.json)
- [Arc Curve Model](/Example/data-model/arc-curve.json)
- [Line Curve Model](/Example/data-model/line-curve.json)
- [Nurbs Curve Model](/Example/data-model/nurbs-curve.json)

#### Packet Data Model
Packet is a generic model that wraps the data being sent. It includes the data itself and metadata about the data.
- [Packet Data Model](/Example/data-model/packet-points.json)

### Headers
Portal uses headers to identify properties of the data being sent. These headers are used to determine the type of data being sent, the compression status, and other relevant information.

| Field        | type     | Size (bytes) | Description                                                              |
| ------------ | -------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| MagicNumber  | `byte[]` | 2            | Header identifier. Value: `0x70, 0x6b` (ASCII: `pk`)                     |
| isCompressed | `bool`   | 1            | Compression flag                                                         |
| isEncrypted  | `bool`   | 1            | Encryption flag                                                          |
| CRC16        | `int16`  | 2            | [CRC-16 checksum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_redundancy_check) |
| size         | `int32`  | 4            | Payload size                                                             |
| **Total**    |          | **10**       | **Total header size**                                                    |
